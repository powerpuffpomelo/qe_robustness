resistance to aztreonam , other antibiotics and treatment-emergent microorganisms 
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
an association between persistent isolation of MRSA and more severe disease and increased mortality has been reported in the literature . 
overall , 539 patients ( 78 % adults ) were treated in these studies . 
patients continued on their baseline medications , including macrolide antibiotics . 
individual patients ’ plasma aztreonam concentrations exhibited considerable variability . 
the elimination half-life of aztreonam from serum is approximately 2.1 hours for inhalation administration , similar to what has been reported for aztreonam for injection . 
in healthy subjects 60-70 % of a single I . m . or I . v. dose was recovered in the urine by 8 hours , and urinary excretion was essentially complete by 12 hours . 
however , all mean sputum concentration values were associated with relatively large standard deviations . 
genotoxicity ( chromosomal aberration and mouse lymphoma mutation assay ) studies with aztreonam were negative .

you must use the Cayston specific Altera nebuliser Handset containing an Altera aerosol head . 
it ’ s best to use Cayston immediately after you have made up the solution . 
preparing the Altera nebuliser to take your Cayston 
pour all of the prepared Cayston from the vial into the Altera nebuliser Handset medicine reservoir ( Figure 2a ) . 
sit in a relaxed , upright position . 
press and hold the on / off button on the control unit for a few seconds . 
you will hear one “ beep ” and the status light will turn green . 
if there is more than a few drops of liquid left , replace the medicine cap and restart treatment . 
what if I need to stop my treatment before I ’ ve finished ? 
if you notice that the performance has changed before this time ( for instance , if it takes longer to produce a mist , more than 5 minutes ) , please refer to the Altera nebuliser instructions for use . 
if you have taken more Cayston than you should , talk to a doctor or pharmacist immediately . 
the frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention : 
as an inhaled medicine , Cayston could cause you to cough and this could lead to coughing up blood . 
do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the vial label , solvent ampoule and the carton . 
what Cayston and the solvent contain 
cayston is a sterile , white to off-white , lyophilised powder . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
in patients with cystic fibrosis , p . aeruginosa infections usually start in the first 10 years of life and can cause long-term lung problems . 
this prevents the bacteria from building their cell walls , which kills them . 
an additional study compared four weeks of Cayston with placebo in patients with mild lung disease due to cystic fibrosis . 
in clinical trials , FABLYN-treated women had an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events ( deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism ) compared to placebo . 
does not eliminate the risk of breast cancer ( see section 5.1 ) . 
lasofoxifene is highly protein bound , predominantly cleared by metabolism and is likely to undergo enterohepatic circulation ( see section 5.2 ) . 
5 - year results from large , multinational fracture trial ( Pearl ) 
Table 2 : fracture incidence in postmenopausal women over 5 years 
women in this study had a median age of 63 years ( range 44 to 79 ) and a median time since menopause of 13 years . 
lasofoxifene may be associated with benign endometrial effects : endometrial cystic change viewed on ultrasound and histological benign cystic atrophy ( a variant of atrophic endometrium ) , contributing to approximately 1.5 mm increase in mean endometrial thickness . 
vaginal bleeding was reported in 74 ( 2.6 % ) FABLYN-treated women versus 37 ( 1.3 % ) placebo-treated women . 
lasofoxifene binds to both albumin and α 1 - acid glycoprotein ; however , it does not affect the binding of either warfarin or propranolol . 
detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European medicines 
if you take more tablets than you should , tell your doctor or pharmacist . 
osteoporosis is more common in women after the menopause , when the levels of the female hormone oestrogen fall : oestrogen slows down bone breakdown and makes the bones less likely to fracture . 
over five years , 6 % of the women taking FABLYN 500 micrograms had a new spine fracture ( 155 out of 2,748 ) , compared with 9 % of those taking placebo ( 255 out of 2,744 ) . 
enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose . 
patients should be closely monitored throughout this period . 
cases of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) have been reported with antipsychotic drugs . 
however , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole . 
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs . 
other potent inhibitors of cyp3a 4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied . 
carbamazepine and other cyp3a 4 inducers 
the following adverse reactions occurred more often ( ≥ 1/100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) . 
common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache 
in another long-term 26 - week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients . 
in another 12 - week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium . 
an elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups . 
blood and lymphatic system disorders : leukopenia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia 
in clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdose of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities . 
following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers . 
after a 13-26 week stabilisation on aripiprazole ( 2-15 mg / day ) patients with a stable response were either maintained on aripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks . 
week 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group . 
the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of cyp2d 6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of cyp2d 6 . 
these included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/kg/day ( 3 to 
0.2 mg propyl parahydroxybenzoate ( e216 ) per ml 
the oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may cause allergic reactions ( possibly delayed ) . 
in a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of cyp2d 6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged . 
to enhance absorption and minimise variability , injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus maximus muscle , avoiding adipose regions , is recommended . 
in intravenous reproductive toxicity studies , no new safety concerns were observed at maternal exposures up to 15 (rat) and 29 (rabbit) times human exposure at 30 mg . 
each tablet contains 5 mg of aripiprazole . • the other ingredients are lactose monohydrate , maize starch , microcrystalline cellulose , hydroxypropyl cellulose , magnesium stearate , indigo carmine aluminium lake ( e132 ) . 
if you are concerned that you are given more ABILIFY solution for injection than you feel necessary , tell your doctor or nurse of your concern . 
to prevent manic episodes in adults , the same dose should be continued . 
the oral solution or orodispersible tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets . 
Caelyx should be given under the supervision of a doctor who is qualified in the use of cytotoxic ( cell - killing ) medicines . 
for multiple myeloma , the effectiveness of the combination of Caelyx and bortezomib was compared with that of bortezomib alone in 646 patients . 
the marketing authorisation Holder is JANSSEN-CILAG International NV . 
the total dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride must also take into account any previous ( or concomitant ) therapy with cardiotoxic compounds such as other anthracyclines / anthraquinones or e.g. , 5 - fluorouracil . 
contrast to the experience in patients with breast cancer or ovarian cancer , myelosuppression appears to be the dose-limiting adverse event in patients with AIDS-KS ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in most patients treatment can be resumed after all symptoms have resolved , without recurrence . 
pyridoxine at a dose of 50-150 mg per day and corticosteroids have been used for the prophylaxis and treatment of PPE , however , these therapies have not been evaluated in phase III trials . 
Grade 3 PPE was reported in 5 % of patients . 
treatment discontinuation of one or both agents due to adverse events was seen in 38 % of patients . 
in addition , endomyocardial biopsies were performed in 8 solid tumour patients with cumulative anthracycline doses of 509 mg / m 2 – 1,680 mg / m 2 . 
as with other DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents , secondary acute myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasias have been reported in patients having received combined treatment with doxorubicin . 
if any signs or symptoms of extravasation occur ( e.g. , stinging , erythema ) terminate the infusion immediately and restart in another vein . 
the apparent half-life ranged from 24-231 hours , with a mean of 73.9 hours . 
it is recommended that the Caelyx infusion line be connected through the side port of an intravenous infusion of 5 % ( 50 mg / ml ) glucose . 
stinging or swelling of the skin at the site of injection may also occur . 
- you get swelling , warmth , or tenderness in the soft tissues of your leg , sometimes with pain which gets worse when you stand or walk . 
- joint pain , decreased or abnormal sensation to stimulation , inflammation of the cornea , redness of the eye , redness of the scrotum may occur with a combination of Caelyx and bortezomib .

patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis . 
in clinical trials , weight did not change from baseline when vildagliptin 100 mg daily was added to metformin ( +0.2 kg and -1.0 kg for vildagliptin and placebo , respectively ) . 
clinical trials of up to 2 years ’ duration did not show any additional safety signals or unforeseen risks with vildagliptin monotherapy . 
the incidence of hypoglycaemia was significantly lower in the vildagliptin group ( 1.7 % ) than in the glimepiride group ( 16.2 % ) . 
however , there were imbalances in baseline cardiovascular risk favouring placebo and the number of events was low , precluding firm conclusions . 
available in packs containing 7 , 14 , 28 , 30 , 56 , 60 , 90 , 112 , 180 or 336 tablets and in multipacks containing 336 ( 3 packs of 112 ) tablets . 
this is so that signs of increased liver enzymes can be detected as early as possible . 
in combination with glimepiride , both 50 mg and 100 mg daily doses caused a reduction of around 0.6 percentage points . 
the active substance in BeneFIX , nonacog alfa , is a blood coagulation factor protein ( a substance that helps the blood to clot ) . 
60-100 repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved . 
in the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis ( plasma factor IX activity ) is indispensable . 
there is limited documentation of on-demand treatment and surgery in paediatric patients less than 6 years of age treated with BeneFIX . 
administration by continuous infusion has not been approved and is not recommended ( see also sections 4.4 , 4.8 and 6.6 ) . 
Activity-neutralizing antibodies ( inhibitors ) are an Uncommon event in previously treated patients ( PTPs ) receiving factor IX-containing products . 
there have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube / syringe with the administration of BeneFIX . 
based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women , experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available . 
therefore , factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast - feeding only if clearly indicated . 
the aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated . 
allergic reactions might be experienced more frequently in children than in adults . 
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX , ( nonacog alfa ) . 
recombinant coagulation factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 55,000 daltons that is a Member of the serine protease family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors . 
factor IX activity is absent or greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia B and substitution therapy may be required . 
the only documented serious adverse event related with BeneFIX was reported from the only included pup , who experienced hypersensitivity and inhibitor development . 
use only the pre-filled syringe provided in the box for reconstitution . 
patients who have specific mutations of their factor IX gene such as major deletion may be more likely to develop an inhibitor to factor IX and / or experience allergic reactions . 
break off the tamper-resistant plastic tip cap from the solvent syringe by snapping the perforation of the cap . 
detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently pulling and turning the syringe counter - clockwise . 
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in adult patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated ( see section 4.4 ) . 
following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy , additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg / m 2 . 
no additional dosage reductions , other than those for all patients , are recommended for patients 65 years and older . 
rare occurrences of severe hypersensitivity reactions , including very rare events of anaphylactic reactions with fatal outcome , have been reported . 
paclitaxel clearance is primarily determined by cyp2c 8 and cyp3a 4 mediated metabolism followed by biliary excretion , while gemcitabine is inactivated by cytidine deaminase followed by urinary excretion . 
Abraxane is indicated as monotherapy for breast cancer , or in combination with gemcitabine for pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( see section 4.1 ) . 
because of potential serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants , Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation . 
monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis . 
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles of approximately 130 nM in size , where the paclitaxel is present in a non-crystalline , amorphous state . 
in one study , Abraxane was administered as a 30 - minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg / m 2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer . 
the key secondary endpoints were progression - free survival ( PFS ) and overall response rate ( ORR ) , both assessed by independent , central , blinded radiological review using RECIST guidelines ( version 1.0 ) . 
following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m 2 , paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner . 
Figure 2 shows the correlation between paclitaxel clearance and total blood bilirubin as measured just prior to dosing . 
do not breast feed when taking Abraxane as it is not known if the active ingredient paclitaxel passes into the mother ’ s milk . 
only a doctor who has experience in treating patients with Fabry disease or other inherited metabolic diseases should give Fabrazyme . 
this was accompanied by improvements in symptoms and quality of life . 
Fabrazyme 35 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
the initial infusion rate should be no more than 0.25 mg / min ( 15 mg / hour ) to minimise the potential occurrence of infusion-associated reactions . 
the decision to have a patient move to home infusion should be made after evaluation and recommendation by the treating physician . 
these patients should be treated with caution when re-administering agalsidase beta ( see section 4.8 ) . 
adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity : 
after intravenous infusion , agalsidase beta is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken up by vascular endothelial and parenchymal cells into lysosomes , likely through the mannose -6 phosphate , mannose and asialoglycoprotein receptors . 
package sizes : 1 , 5 and 10 vials per carton . 
- the need to keep a diary to document each treatment received at home and to bring it at each visit 
the level of support required for home infusion will be discussed and agreed by the patient and / or caregiver with the prescribing physician . 
- necessary skills have to be acquired by non-healthcare professionals before Fabrazyme may be safely and effectively administered at home . 
determine the number of vials to be reconstituted based on the individual patient 's weight and remove the required vials from the refrigerator in order to allow them to reach room temperature ( in approximately 30 minutes ) . 
what you need to know before you use Fabrazyme 
it should be given at the same time each day . 
bimatoprost is a prostaglandin analogue , ( a copy of the natural substance prostaglandin ) that works by increasing the drainage of fluid out of the eye . 
GANFORT was , however , more effective than bimatoprost in patients whose pressure was not controlled with eye drops containing prostaglandins alone . 
β-blocking ophthalmological preparations may block systemic β-agonist effects e.g. of adrenaline . 
in patients with a history of mild liver disease or abnormal alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and / or bilirubin at baseline , bimatoprost had no adverse reactions on liver function over 24 months . 
GANFORT should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation ( e.g. uveitis ) because the inflammation may be exacerbated . 
thus , it is important to apply GANFORT as instructed and avoid it running onto the cheek or other skin areas . 
the frequency of possible adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention : 
a topical overdose with GANFORT is not likely to occur or to be associated with toxicity . 
the mechanism of action by which bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure in man is by increasing aqueous humour outflow through the trabecular meshwork and enhancing uveoscleral outflow . 
however , consideration should be given to the likelihood of compliance when considering either morning or evening dosing . 
no enhancement of the systemic absorption of the individual active substances has been observed with GANFORT ( multi-dose formulation ) . 
syncope , cerebrovascular accident , increase in signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis , paresthaesia , cerebral ischaemia 
once the pouch is opened , use the single-dose containers within 7 days . 
- if you have heart problems such as low heart rate , heart block , or heart failure 
this helps to stop GANFORT getting into the rest of the body .

epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e.g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) ) . 
no other ESA therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction . 
occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum . 
in lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended . 
other common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials of epoetin alfa are deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , seizures , diarrhoea , nausea , headache , influenza like illness , pyrexia , rash , and vomiting . 
in chronic renal failure patients , haemoglobin levels greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) may be associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events , including death ( see section 4.4 ) . 
in the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls . 
the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours . 
in animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose . 
side effects from an overdose of Abseamed are unlikely . 
these may affect more than 1 in every 10 people using Abseamed . • flu-like symptoms , such as headache , aches and pains in the joints , fever , feeling of weakness , tiredness and dizziness . 
this means that Abseamed is similar to and contains the same active substance as a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) , which is known as the ‘ reference medicine ’ . 
anidulafungin is not a clinically relevant substrate , inducer , or inhibitor of cytochrome p450 isoenzymes ( 1 A2 , 2 B6 , 2 C8 , 2 C9 , 2c19 , 2 D6 , 3A ) . 
drug interaction studies were performed with anidulafungin and other medicinal products likely to be co-administered . 
in case of overdose , adverse reactions may occur as mentioned in section 4.8. 
during clinical trials , a single 400 mg dose of anidulafungin was inadvertently administered as a loading dose . 
for the clinical relevance of these findings see “ clinical efficacy and safety . ” 
patients with microbiologically confirmed invasive candidiasis ( MITT population ) and neutropenia were identified in an analysis of pooled data from 4 similarly designed prospective , open-label , non - comparative studies . 
it is unlikely that anidulafungin will have clinically relevant effects on the metabolism of drugs metabolised by cytochrome p450 isoenzymes . 
anidulafungin has a predominant elimination half-life of approximately 24 hours that characterizes the majority of the plasma concentration-time profile , and a terminal half-life of 40-50 hours that characterises the terminal elimination phase of the profile . 
anidulafungin crossed the placental barrier in rats and was detected in foetal plasma . 
B infusion solution concentration is 0.77 mg / ml 
excipients : fructose , mannitol , polysorbate 80 , tartaric acid and NaOH and / or HCl for pH adjustment .

the rate of infusion should not exceed 1.1 mg / min ( equivalent to 1.4 ml / min when reconstituted and diluted per instructions ) . 
Fareston is used to treat hormone-dependent metastatic breast cancer in women who have been through the menopause . ‘ metastatic ’ means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body . 
Fareston has been shown to prolong the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram in some patients in a dose - related manner . 
the results of this study show a clear positive effect of toremifene in the 80 mg group with mean prolongations of 21 - 26 MS . 
- antiarrhythmics class Ia ( e.g. quinidine , hydroquinidine , disopyramide ) or 
in general , however , nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivatives are predominantly anti-estrogenic in rats and man and estrogenic in mice . 
the half-life of the first ( distribution ) phase is 4 ( range 2 - 12 ) hours , and of the second ( elimination ) phase 5 ( range 2 - 10 ) days . 
in vivo , high plasma concentrations in monkeys caused a 24 % prolongation in QTc , which is in line with 
- if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to certain sugars , like lactose ( see section 2 Fareston contains lactose ) . 
- water tablets ( diuretics of thiazide type ) 
do not take Fareston together with the following medicines as there is an increased risk that your heartbeat may be altered ( see section 2 do not take Fareston ) : 
treatment with Effentora should be started by and remain under the guidance of a doctor who has experience in the management of opioid treatment in cancer patients . 
physicians should keep in mind the potential of abuse of fentanyl . 
in case of buccal mucosa irritation , a change in tablet placement within the buccal cavity should be recommended . 
patients and their carers must be instructed that Effentora contains an active substance in an amount that can be fatal , especially to a child . 
coadministration with agents that induce 3 A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of Effentora . 
if Effentora is administered , an antidote for the child should be readily available . 
therefore it is not possible to definitively separate the effects of Effentora alone . 
tolerance , physical and / or psychological dependence may develop upon repeated administration of opioids such as fentanyl . 
consult the Summary of product Characteristics of the individual opioid antagonist for details about such use . 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : analgesics ; opioids ; ATC code n02ab 03 . 
the safety and efficacy of Effentora have been evaluated in patients taking the drug at the onset of the breakthrough pain episode . 
Sixty-seven percent of the patients were able to be titrated to an effective dose . 
transient pH changes accompanying the effervescent reaction may optimise dissolution ( at a lower pH ) and membrane permeation ( at a higher pH ) . 
Cmax and auc0 -8 were 1 % and 25 % higher in patients with mucositis compared to those without mucositis , respectively . 
in a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats , a male-mediated effect was observed at high doses ( 300 mcg/kg/day , s . C . ) and is considered secondary to the sedative effects of fentanyl in animal studies . 
further findings at maternally toxic doses in F1 pups were delayed physical development , sensory functions , reflexes and behaviour .

Effentora must not be prescribed in patients with short term pain only 
not to be sucked , chewed or swallowed whole . 
once the right dose has been determined with your doctor , use 1 tablet for an episode of breakthrough pain as a general rule . 
Effentora like other fentanyl products can cause very severe breathing problems which can lead to death . 
this leads to less bone loss in osteoporosis and less disease activity in Paget ’ s disease . 
the second study compared Aclasta with placebo in 2,127 men and women with osteoporosis who had recently broken their hip , and looked at the number of fractures over up to five years . 
Aclasta must not be used in patients with severe kidney problems , hypocalcaemia ( low blood calcium levels ) , or in pregnant or breast-feeding women . 
each ml of the solution contains 0.05 mg zoledronic acid anhydrous ( as monohydrate ) .

- pregnancy and breast-feeding ( see section 4.6 ) . 
these fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients experience thigh or groin pain , often associated with imaging features of stress fractures , weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture . 
caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e.g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) ( see section 4.4 ) .

this corresponds to a 28 % reduction in the risk of all cause mortality ( p = 0.01 ) . 
all participants received 1,000 mg elemental calcium plus 400 to 1,000 IU vitamin d supplementation per day . 
in the pooled results , a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to baseline were observed over 6 months for Aclasta and risedronate . 
dystocia was observed at the lowest dose ( 0.01 mg / kg body weight ) tested in rats . 
zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential .

decreased circulating levels of sex hormones , mainly oestrogens converted from androgens , also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men . 
follow all instructions given to you by your doctor , pharmacist or nurse carefully before you are given Aclasta . 
it is currently unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have received Aclasta .

CANCIDAS should be used with caution in children below 12 months of age , because it has not been studied sufficiently in this age group . 
for adult patients with mild hepaticimpairment ( Child-Pugh score 5 to 6 ) , no dosage adjustment is needed . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance or sucrase – isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product ( see section 2 ) . 
in clinical studies , caspofungin did not induce the cyp3a 4 metabolism of other substances . 
clinical studies in healthy adult volunteers show that the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin are not altered to a clinically relevant extent by itraconazole , amphotericin B , mycophenolate , nelfinavir , or tacrolimus . 
there are no or limited data from the use of caspofungin in pregnant women . 
there are no clinical data for caspofungin to assess its impact on fertility . 
the mechanism of resistance identified was fks1 / fks2 gene mutation . 
the study excluded patients with suspected Candida endocarditis , meningitis , or osteomyelitis . 
patients in the caspofungin group experienced breakthrough infections due to the following Uncommon yeasts and moulds : Trichosporon species ( 1 ) , Fusarium species ( 1 ) , Mucor species ( 1 ) , and Rhizopus species ( 1 ) .

for any information about this medicinal product , please contact the local representative of the 
for patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with insulin and the maximal tolerated dose of metformin 
if necessary , the dose of the anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation . 
for this reason , it is possible that potent cyp3a 4 inhibitors ( i.e. , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir , clarithromycin ) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD . 
sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations , and may be a mild inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in vivo . 
patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight ( -1.5 kg ) compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide ( +1.1 kg ) . 
- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality : metformin 
7.5 events / 1,000 patient-years , diet alone 12.7 events / 1,000 patient-years , p = 0.017 
the NOEL in these studies was observed at exposures to sitagliptin of approximately 6 times the human exposure and to metformin of approximately 2.5 times the human exposure . 
transient treatment-related physical signs , some of which suggest neural toxicity , such as open-mouth breathing , salivation , white foamy emesis , ataxia , trembling , decreased activity , and / or hunched posture were observed in dogs at exposure levels approximately 
because of the high safety margin ( 19 - fold at this no-effect level ) , these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the situation in humans . 
in clinical trials , sitagliptin as monotherapy improved glycaemic control with significant reductions in haemoglobin A1c ( HbA 1c ) and fasting and postprandial glucose .

these medical conditions can increase your chance of getting pancreatitis , or getting it again ( see section 4 ) 
- if you have type 1 diabetes . 
if you experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis stop taking Efficib and consult a doctor immediately ( see section 4 ) 
if you are not sure if any of the above apply to you , talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
very common : nausea , vomiting , diarrhoea , stomachacheand loss of appetite . 
two of the studies looked at sitagliptin as an add-on to metformin : the first compared it with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) in 701 patients , and the second compared it with glipizide ( a sulphonylurea ) in 
Efficib was more effective than metformin alone . 
Actos also improved the glucose control obtained in type 2 diabetes when it was added to existing treatment with a sulphonylurea , insulin or metformin , or the combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea . 
- current bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer 
since insulin and pioglitazone are both associated with fluid retention , concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema . 
it is recommended , therefore , that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes . 
there was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin ( 4 % relative reduction ) and haematocrit ( 4.1 % relative reduction ) during therapy with pioglitazone , consistent with haemodilution . 
fractures were observed in 2.6 % of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7 % of women treated with a comparator . 
the fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator . 
the risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of patients treated with pioglitazone . 
interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes , e.g. oral contraceptives , cyclosporin , calcium channel blockers , and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected . 
6 in active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy was 2 – 3 kg over one year . 
this is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group . 
rare cases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing experience . 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : drugs used in diabetes , blood glucose lowering drugs , excl . insulins ; ATC code : a10bg 03 . 
pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors ( peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals . 
these effects were independent of pioglitazone ’ s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significantly different to glibenclamide . 
these findings were observed across species at plasma concentrations ≤ 4 times the clinical exposure . 
the formation and presence of urinary calculi with subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was postulated as the mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response in the male rat . 
the presence of microcrystals exacerbated the hyperplastic response but was not considered to be the primary cause of hyperplastic changes . 
it is an anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 ( non-insulin dependent ) diabetes mellitus in adults , when metformin is not suitable or has failed to work adequately .

when a patient is given the vaccine , the immune system recognises the surface antigens as ‘ foreign ’ and makes antibodies against them . 
the antibodies will help to protect against the disease caused by the virus . 
the vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases . 
as no data are available for the concomitant administration of this particular vaccine with other vaccines , an interval of 2 to 3 weeks should be respected . 
you may feel tired or get a headache after receiving Fendrix . 
the recommended dose of Gliolan is 20 mg per kilogram body weight , taken two to four hours before the patient is anaesthetised . 
the most common side effects seen with Gliolan are due to a combination of the medicine itself , as well as anaesthesia and the removal of the tumour . 
Gliolan should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to 5 - aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride or porphyrins . 
the Committee decided that Gliolan ’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the visualisation of malignant tissue during surgery for malignant glioma . 
fluorescence-guided resection in these patients has been found to impose a higher risk of critical neurological deficits . 
in a comparative , unblinded phase III trial ( MC-ALS .3 / GLI ) , 201 patients with malignant gliomas received 5 - ALA HCl in a dose of 20 mg / kg body weight and 176 of these patients underwent fluorescence-guided resection with subsequent radiotherapy . 
increased levels of amylase , total bilirubin , and leukocytes , but decreased levels of thrombocytes and erythrocytes were observed , however differences between treatment groups were not statistically significant . 
during surgery he developed respiratory insufficiency , which was managed by adaptation of ventilation . 
approximately 30 % of an orally administered dose of 20 mg / kg body weight is excreted unchanged in urine within 12 hours .

after the 8 - week prophylaxis period , the incidences of flares increased and gradually decreased over time ( 64 % and 70 % of subjects received treatment for gout flares from week 8-52 ) . 
effects in non-clinical studies were generally observed at exposures in excess of the maximum human exposure . 
it may also include ulcers in the mouth , throat , nose , genitals and conjunctivitis ( red and swollen eyes ) . 
if you have developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome with the use of febuxostat , you must not be re - started on ADENURIC at any time . 
ADENURIC 80 mg and 120 mg is available in packs containing 14 , 28 , 42 , 56 , 84 and 98 film-coated tablets . 
it can also be given as an infusion lasting two hours starting within 24 hours after the transplant , for up to 14 days . 
in children aged between two and 18 years , the dose of CellCept is calculated depending on height and weight and should be given by mouth . 
in the body , it is converted into mycophenolic acid , which blocks an enzyme called ‘ inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ’ . 
as some adverse reactions occur with greater frequency in 
on theoretical grounds , therefore , it should be avoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase ( HGPRT ) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome . 
these data support extrapolation of this finding to all antacids because the reduction in exposure when CellCept was co - administered with magnesium and aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when CellCept was co-administered with PPIs . 
no substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and CellCept dose adjustment is not required . 
non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 3.6 % of patients ; other types of malignancy occurred in 1.1 % of patients . 
all transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections ; the risk increased with total immunosuppressive load ( see section 4.4 ) . 
however , the following treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric population , particularly in children under 6 years of age , when compared to adults : diarrhoea , sepsis , leucopenia , anaemia and infection . 
adverse reactions , probably or possibly related to CellCept , reported in patients treated with CellCept in renal , cardiac and hepatic clinical trials when used in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids 
pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients given 600 mg / m 2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily . 
these effects occurred at systemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 2 g / day for renal transplant recipients . 
in a female fertility and reproduction study conducted in rats , oral doses of 
4.5 mg • kg -1 • day -1 caused malformations ( including anophthalmia , agnathia , and hydrocephaly ) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity .

excipient with known effect : each tablet contains 2.7 mg lactose . 
administration of the 60 mg prasugrel loading dose in the fasted state may provide most rapid onset of action ( see section 5.2 ) . 
statins : atorvastatin ( 80 mg daily ) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel and its inhibition of platelet aggregation . 
inducers of cytochromes p450 : rifampicin ( 600 mg daily ) , a potent inducer of cyp3a and cyp2b 6 , and an inducer of cyp2c 9 , cyp2c 19 , and cyp2c 8 , did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel . 
Efient was administered without regard to food in TRITON . 
these may be signs of a severe allergic reaction ( see section 2 ‘ what you need to know before you take Efient ’ ) 
oesophageal reactions ( sometimes severe and requiring hospitalisation ) , such as oesophagitis , oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions , rarely followed by oesophageal stricture , have been reported in patients receiving alendronate . 
osteonecrosis of the jaw , generally associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including osteomyelitis ) , has been reported in patients with cancer who are receiving treatment regimens including primarily intravenously administered bisphosphonates . 
however , there have been rare reports of symptomatic hypocalcaemia , which have occasionally been severe and often occurred in patients with predisposing conditions ( e.g. hypoparathyroidism , vitamin d deficiency and calcium malabsorption ) ( see section 4.8 ) . 
patients with malabsorption may not adequately absorb vitamin D3 . 
the impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception , the particular bisphosphonate used , and the route of administration ( intravenous versus oral ) on the risk has not been studied . 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : drugs for treatment of bone diseases , bisphosphonates , combinations , ATC code : m05bb 03 
studies in rats show that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg / kg intravenous administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine . 
therefore , somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function ( see section 4.2 ) .

ADROVANCE is a tablet containing the two active substances , alendronic acid ( commonly called alendronate ) and colecalciferol known as vitamin D3 . 
as well as your treatment with ADROVANCE , your doctor may suggest you make changes to your lifestyle to help your condition , such as : 
you must wait at least 30 minutes before taking any food and beverages except water . 
it is important that you continue taking ADROVANCE for as long as your doctor prescribes the medicine . 
it will help if you make a note of what you experienced , when it started and how long it lasted . 
the active substances are alendronic acid and colecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) . 
ADROVANCE is a medicine that contains two active substances : alendronic acid and colecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) . 
to avoid irritation of the oesophagus ( gullet ) , the patient should not lie down until after their first food of the day , which should be at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . 
alendronic acid is a bisphosphonate that has been used in osteoporosis since the mid -1990 s . 
this is an inherited disease in which patients are unable to make enough haemoglobin , the protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body . 
the usual dose of Ferriprox is 75 mg per kilogram body weight each day , divided into three separate doses . 
dose per kilogram body weight should be calculated to the nearest half tablet . 
to obtain a dose of about 75 mg/kg/day , use the number of tablets suggested in the following Table for the body weight of the patient . 
the active substance is deferiprone ( 3 - hydroxy -1,2 - dimethylpyridin -4 - one ) , a bidentate ligand which binds to iron in a 3 : 1 molar ratio . 
iron overload causes concentration-dependent MRI T2 * signal loss , thus , increased myocardial iron reduces myocardial MRI T2 * values . 
myocardial MRI T2 * values of less than 20 milliseconds represent iron overload in the heart . 
a positive correlation between MRI T2 * values and cardiac function ( as measured by left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ) has been documented . 
study la16 -0102 compared the efficacy of Ferriprox with that of deferoxamine in decreasing cardiac iron overload and in improving cardiac function ( as measured by LVEF ) in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients . 
a variable amount of elimination via the faeces has been reported . 
each ml of oral solution contains 100 mg deferiprone ( 25 g deferiprone in 250 ml and 50 g deferiprone in 500 ml ) . 
in the majority of these patients , the increase was asymptomatic and transient , and returned to baseline without discontinuation or decreasing the dose of deferiprone ( see section 4.4 ) . 
your doctor will also ask you to come in for tests to monitor body iron load .

Fertavid was as effective as urinary 
the concurrent determination of serum oestradiol levels may also be useful . 
clinical experience with Fertavid is based on up to three treatment cycles in both indications . 
in clinical studies it was shown that maintenance dosages ranging from 75-375 IU for six to twelve days are sufficient , although longer treatment may be necessary . 
early OHSS usually occurs within 10 days after hCG administration and may be associated with an excessive ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation . 
rates of pregnancy loss in women undergoing assisted reproduction techniques are higher than in the normal population . 
the incidence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions . 
the use of Fertavid during pregnancy is not indicated . 
clinical use of Fertavid by the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes may lead to local reactions at the site of injection ( 3 % of all patients treated ) . 
generalised hypersensitivity reactions have been observed uncommonly ( approximately 0.2 % of all patients treated with follitropin beta ) . 
local reactions at the site of injection include induration and pain . 
in repeated-dose studies in rats ( two weeks ) and dogs ( 13 weeks ) up to 100 - fold the maximal human dose , Fertavid induced no toxicologically significant effects .

the recommended dosage of Glivec is 600 mg / day for adult patients in accelerated phase . 
if tolerated , the dose can be increased for lack of efficacy ( see sections 4.4 and 5.2 ) . 
as cardiac adverse events have been reported uncommonly with imatinib , a careful assessment of the benefit / risk of imatinib therapy should be considered in the HES / CEL population before treatment initiation . 
however , since the effects of low-dose exposure of the infant to imatinib are unknown , women taking imatinib should not breast - feed . 
these reactions can usually be managed by withholding Glivec temporarily and with diuretics and other appropriate supportive care measures . 
however , some of these reactions may be serious or life - threatening and several patients with blast crisis died with a complex clinical history of pleural effusion , congestive heart failure and renal failure .

eleven patients achieved rapid CHR ; ten had complete resolution of cytogenetic abnormalities and a decrease or disappearance of fusion transcripts as measured by RT-PCR . 
immunohistochemistry was routinely performed with kit antibody ( a-4502 , rabbit polyclonal antiserum , 1:10 0 ; DAKO Corporation , Carpinteria , Ca ) according to analysis by an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method after antigen retrieval . 
seventeen ( 17 ) patients with GIST ( with or without kit and PDGFR mutations ) were reported in 7 publications . 
the translocation t ( 17:22 ) [ ( q 22 : q 13 ) ] , or its gene product , was present in nearly all responders to Glivec treatment . 
there are no controlled trials in paediatric patients with DFSP . 
the pharmacokinetics of Glivec have been evaluated over a dosage range of 25 to 1,000 mg . 
the main circulating metabolite in humans is the N-demethylated piperazine derivative , which shows similar in vitro potency to the parent . 
the plasma protein binding of the N-demethylated metabolite is similar to that of the parent compound . 
imatinib and the N-demethyl metabolite together accounted for about 65 % of the circulating radioactivity ( AUC ( 0-48 h ) ) . 
imatinib was shown in vitro to be a competitive inhibitor of marker substrates for cyp2c 9 , cyp2d 6 and cyp3a 4/5 . 
in this patient population , the presence of hepatic metastases could potentially lead to hepatic insufficiency and reduced metabolism . 
after correcting for the BSA effect , other demographics such as age , body weight and body mass index did not have clinically significant effects on the exposure of imatinib . 
one of these intermediates was also positive in the mouse lymphoma assay . 
teratogenic effects included exencephaly or encephalocele , absent / reduced frontal and absent parietal bones .

following conversion , tacrolimus trough levels should be monitored and if necessary dose adjustments made to maintain similar systemic exposure . 
blood trough levels of tacrolimus should be monitored during the post-transplantation period . 
dose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment in order to maintain the tacrolimus blood trough levels within the recommended target range . 
a forgotten morning dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day . 
high potassium intake or potassium-sparing diuretics should be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . 
if abnormalities develop , dose reduction of Advagraf , or change of treatment to another immunosuppressive agent should be considered . 
therefore , in this patient group , EBV-VCA serology should be ascertained before starting treatment with Advagraf . 
among these conditions are BK virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) . 
other interactions potentially leading to increased tacrolimus blood levels 
however , cases of spontaneous abortion have been reported . 
common : eye disorders , vision blurred , photophobia Uncommon : cataract rare : blindness 
in cases of oral intoxication , gastric lavage and / or the use of adsorbents ( such as activated charcoal ) may be helpful , if used shortly after intake . 
in particular , tacrolimus inhibits the formation of cytotoxic lymphocytes , which are mainly responsible for graft rejection . 
the efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf , both in combination with mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) and corticosteroids , was compared in 667 de Novo kidney transplant recipients . 
the efficacy and safety of Prograf , ciclosporin and Advagraf , all in combination with basiliximab antibody induction , MMF and corticosteroids , was compared in 638 de Novo kidney transplant recipients . 
another randomised study included 66 patients on tacrolimus versus 67 patients on ciclosporin . 
acute rejection episodes per 100 patient-days were numerically fewer in the tacrolimus ( 0.85 episodes ) than in the ciclosporin group ( 1.09 episodes ) . 
in an additional two-centre study , 26 patients were randomised to the tacrolimus versus 24 patients to the ciclosporin group . 
the 1 - year survival rates were 73.1 % in the tacrolimus versus 79.2 % in the ciclosporin group . 
in plasma , tacrolimus is highly bound ( > 98.8 % ) to plasma proteins , mainly to serum albumin and α -1 - acid glycoprotein . 
the other metabolites have only weak or no immunosuppressive activity . 
when tacrolimus is administered intravenously as rapid infusion / bolus injection at a dose of 0.1 to 1.0 mg / kg , QTc prolongation has been observed in some animal species . 
in rats , female reproductive function including birth was impaired at toxic doses and the offspring showed reduced birth weights , viability and growth . 
peak blood concentrations achieved with these doses were above 150 ng / ml which is more than 6 - fold higher than mean peak concentrations observed with Advagraf in clinical transplantation .

the mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration with an oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the monitoring of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed . 
following established chemotherapy for solid tumours , lymphomas , and lymphoid leukaemias , it is expected that the duration of treatment required to fulfil these criteria will be up to 14 days . 
normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation 
filgrastim may be given as a daily subcutaneous injection or as a daily intravenous infusion diluted in 
the subcutaneous route is preferred in most cases . 
cases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported uncommonly following administration of filgrastim . 
however , during the period of administration of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation , it should be discontinued or its dose should be reduced if the leukocyte counts rise to > 70 x 109 / l . 
vascular disorders , including veno-occlusive disease and fluid volume disturbances , have been reported occasionally in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation . 
assessment of progenitor cell yields 
yields in excess of this minimum yield appear to correlate with more rapid recovery , those below with slower recovery . 
recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim 
complete blood cell counts with differential and platelet counts , and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and karyotype should be performed prior to treatment . 
MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease and are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy . 
haematuria was common and proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients . 
regular urine analyses should be performed to monitor this event . 
as a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater number of these medicinal products with filgrastim therapy , the patient may be at higher risk of developing thrombocytopenia and anaemia . 
capillary leak syndrome has been reported after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration and is characterised by hypotension , hypoalbuminaemia , oedema and hemoconcentration . 
patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment , which may include a need for intensive care ( see section 4.8 ) . 
an increased incidence of embryo-loss has been observed in rabbits , but no malformation has been seen . 
blood lactate dehydrogenase increased decreased appetitea 
exacerbation of arthritic symptoms has been uncommonly observed . 
as splenomegaly is a common finding in patients with HIV infection and is present to varying degrees in most patients with AIDS , the relationship to filgrastim treatment is unclear . 
neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function . 
four studies looked at the levels of neutrophils in the blood in a total of 146 healthy volunteers who received filgrastim HEXAL or Neupogen . 
the safety and efficacy of Aerinaze in children below the age of 12 years have not been established . 
the tablet may be taken with a full glass of water but must be swallowed entirely ( without crushing , breaking or chewing it ) . 
patients should be informed that the treatment should be discontinued in case of hypertension , tachycardia , palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias , nausea or any other neurological sign ( such as headache or increased headache ) . 
gastric lavage with physiologic saline solution may be performed , particularly in children . 
therefore absorption of pseudoephedrine sulphate was not affected by the Aerinaze formulation .

very rarely : the following other side effects reported during the marketing of desloratadine , may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people 
in both studies , Aerinaze was compared with desloratadine alone and with pseudoephedrine alone . 
Aerinaze was more effective in reducing symptoms than either of the two active substances taken alone . 
it contains the active substance filgrastim . 
during the first 21 - day chemotherapy cycle , patients treated with either filgrastim ratiopharm or Neupogen had severe neutropenia for an average of 1.1 days , compared with 3.8 days in those receiving placebo . 
it is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for the first 2 to 3 days of filgrastim administration . 
musculoskeletal pain is usually controlled with standard analgesics . 
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to filgrastim or to any of the other ingredients of filgrastim ratiopharm . 
- transient low blood pressure , vascular disorders ( which can cause pain , redness and swelling in the limbs )

- a puncture-proof container ( plastic container provided by the hospital or pharmacy ) so you can dispose of used syringes safely . 
do not use any filgrastim ratiopharm that is left in the syringe . 
the recommended dose is 10 mg everolimus once daily . 
discontinue treatment if failure to recover within 4 weeks . 
in such cases topical treatments are recommended , but mouthwashes containing alcohol , peroxide , iodine and thyme derivatives should be avoided as they may exacerbate the condition . 
monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start of Afinitor therapy and periodically thereafter . 
patients should be advised to be cautious when driving or using machines if they experience fatigue during treatment with Afinitor .

the following medicines can increase the blood sugar lowering effect of Glubrava . 
if you experience any of these symptoms , stop taking Glubrava and consult a doctor immediately . 
each capsule contains 50 mg of amprenavir . 
Agenerase capsules should normally be administered with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of amprenavir ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . 
current antiretroviral therapies , including Agenerase , have not been proven to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination . 
caution is advised when Agenerase is used concomitantly with delavirdine ( see section 4.5 ) . 
when ritonavir is co-administered further dose reduction may be necessary ( see section 4.5 ) . 
ritonavir also inhibits cyp2d 6 and induces cyp3a 4 , cyp1a 2 , cyp2c 9 and glucuronosyl transferase . 
the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown . 
no dose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when indinavir is administered in combination with amprenavir . 
lamivudine : the AUC and Cmax of lamivudine and amprenavir , respectively , were both unaltered when these two medicinal products were given concomitantly . 
when it is clinically necessary to co-administer rifabutin with Agenerase , a dosage reduction of at least half the recommended dose of rifabutin is advised , although no clinical data are available . 
erythromycin : no pharmacokinetic study has been performed with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin , however , plasma levels of both medicinal products may be increased when co-administered . 
no dose adjustment for any of the medicinal products is necessary when either ketoconazole or itraconazole is administered in combination with amprenavir . 
antacids : on the basis of the data for other protease inhibitors , it is advisable not to take antacids at the same time as Agenerase , since its absorption may be impaired . 
Moreover , in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period . 
as compared to a non-matched historical control group , co-administration of methadone and amprenavir resulted in a 30 % , 27 % and 25 % decrease in serum amprenavir AUC , Cmax and Cmin respectively . 
no recommendations can currently be made regarding adjustment of amprenavir dose when amprenavir is co-administered with methadone due to the inherent low reliability of non - matched historical controls . 
however , the information currently available is not sufficient for determining the nature of the interaction . 
other substances : plasma concentrations of other substances may be increased by amprenavir . 
some substances ( e.g. lidocaine ( by systemic route ) and halofantrine ) given with Agenerase may cause serious adverse reactions . 
in children , the nature of the safety profile is similar to that seen in adults . 
events ( Grade 2-4 ) reported by study investigators as attributable to study medication and occurring in > 1 % of patients , are included as well as Grade 3-4 treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities . 
severe or life-threatening skin reactions have also occurred in patients treated with amprenavir ( see section 4.4 ) . 
increased CPK , myalgia , myositis , and rarely rhabdomyolysis have been reported with protease inhibitors , particularly in combination with nucleoside analogues . 
if overdose occurs , the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity ( see section 4.8 ) and standard supportive treatment provided as necessary . 
Pharmacotherapeutic group ; protease inhibitor ; ATC code : j05a E05 
concomitant low dose ritonavir was not administered and the majority of the PI experienced subjects had prior exposure to at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NRTIs co-administered with Agenerase . 
this change will decrease the total active substance concentration in the plasma , however the amount of unbound amprenavir , which is the active moiety , is likely to be unchanged . 
the primary route of metabolism is via the cytochrome p450 cyp3a 4 enzyme . 
the primary route of elimination of amprenavir is via hepatic metabolism with less than 3 % excreted unchanged in the urine . 
hepatic impairment : the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir are significantly altered in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment . 
these dosing regimens will provide plasma amprenavir levels comparable to those achieved in healthy subjects given a 1200 mg dose twice daily without concomitant administration of ritonavir . 
conclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to change with additional data , and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems for analysing resistance test results . 
children less than 4 years of age : Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in children less than 4 years of age . ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 ) . 
liver disease : the principal route of metabolism of amprenavir and the propylene glycol excipient is via the liver , Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment or failure ( see section 4.3 ) . 
Agenerase oral solution also contains 4 mg sodium per ml . 
this must be taken into consideration when prescribing to patients on a controlled sodium diet . 
the inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St John ’ s wort ( see section 4.3 ) . • other combinations 
the AUC and Cmax of amprenavir were increased by 31 % and decreased by 16 % respectively . 
metronidazole : Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in patients treated with metronidazole ( see section 4.3 ) . 
- bepridil ( used to treat hypertension ) . 
if your doctor decides it is inappropriate for you to take ritonavir , you will need to take increased doses of Agenerase ( 1200 mg twice a day ) . 
the usual dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg for each kg of body weight , twice a day . 
if you forget to take a dose of Agenerase , take it as soon as you remember and then continue as before . 
on rare occasions , these muscle disorders have been serious ( rhabdomyolysis ) . 
these may include loss of fat from legs , arms and face , increased fat in the abdomen ( belly ) and other internal organs , breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck ( ‘ buffalo hump ’ ) . 
- patients of 4 years of age and older unable to swallow capsules : the dose will be calculated according to your weight by your doctor . 
animal studies showed effects on uterine implantation and parturition ( see section 5.3 ) , but the potential risk for humans is unknow n . 
icatibant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in maternal blood . 
icatibant had no effect on the fertility of male mice and rats ( see section 5.3 ) . 
almost all subjects who were treated with subcutaneous icatibant in clinical trials developed reactions at the site of injection ( characterised by skin irritation , swelling , pain , itchiness , erythema , burning sensation ) .

the common side effects ( may affect up to 1 in 10 people ) are : feeling sick 
the infusion should last three hours . 
the medicine also produced an improvement in lung function , while the patients on placebo showed a slight worsening . 
this will allow quick identification of new safety information . 
infusion-related reactions were treated or ameliorated by slowing the infusion rate , interrupting the infusion , or by administration of medicinal products , such as antihistamines , antipyretics , low-dose corticosteroids ( prednisone and methylprednisolone ) , or beta-agonist nebulisation . 
no patient discontinued treatment due to an infusion reaction during clinical studies . 
caution must be exercised in the management and treatment of such patients by limitation or careful monitoring of antihistamine and other sedative medicinal product use . 
management of patients must be decided on an individual basis . ( see section 4.8 ) .

Ceplene should be given under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of 
the recommended dose of Ceplene is a 0.5 - mg injection under the skin , twice a day , one to three minutes after an interleukin -2 injection . 
Ceplene and interleukin -2 are given for 10 cycles . 
depending on the patient ’ s response to treatment and side effects , the treatment may have to be suspended or the dose adjusted . 
this can increase the length of time the patient stays in remission . 
for dosing instructions for Ceplene in combination with il-2 , see posology below . 
il-2 is administered twice daily as a subcutaneous injection 1 to 3 minutes prior to the administration of Ceplene ; each dose of il-2 is 16 400 IU / kg ( 1 µ g / kg ) . 
for patients experiencing Grade 3 and 4 ( including hypotension , arrhythmia ) toxicities 
one to 3 minutes after the subcutaneous administration of il-2 has been completed , Ceplene should be administered by slow subcutaneous injection at a rate not to exceed 0.1 ml ( 0.1 mg histamine dihydrochloride ) per minute . 
Ceplene can be administered via an ambulatory infusion syringe pump or by controlled manual subcutaneous injection by syringe with a timer . 
4.3 contraindications • hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. • patients with significantly compromised cardiac function , e.g. , NYHA class III / IV . 
Ceplene should be administered 1 to 3 minutes after il-2 administration , and not concomitantly . 
where appropriate , consideration should be made to providing concomitant treatment with a proton pump inhibitor . 
- neuromuscular blocking agents , narcotic analgesics , and various contrast media . 
for Ceplene , no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available . 
by inhibiting oxidase function and reducing ROS production , Ceplene protects il-2 - activated NK cells and t cells from oxygen free radical-induced inhibition and apoptosis . 
histamine concentrations and PK were highly variable across studies , as well as within the normal volunteer and patient groups . 
they are used to inhibit activity of the immune system ( immunosuppressant ) and to reduce inflammation ( see above “ do not use Ceplene ” ) . 
this means that it uses the immune system , the body ’ s natural defences , to bring about its effect . 
there were no differences between the two dose frequencies . • in actinic keratoses , complete clearance after one or two courses of treatment was seen in 54 and 
55 % of Aldara-treated patients in the two studies , compared with 15 and 2 % in the placebo-treated patients . 
monitoring of liver function in patients with known or suspected hepatic disorder is advised during treatment .

you are advised to speak to a healthcare professional if you are concerned about any problems related to taking emergency contraception . 
if you do become pregnant after taking ellaOne , it is important to contact your doctor . 
therefore you should use a reliable barrier contraceptive method such as condom until your next period . ellaOne should not be used together with emergency contraceptives containing levonorgestrel . 
after taking ellaOne , ovulation can return within the same menstrual cycle . 
- if you vomit within 3 hours of taking an ellaOne tablet , you should consult your doctor or healthcare provider in order to take another tablet . 
- the active substance is ulipristal acetate . 
for pregnancy to occur there has to be ovulation ( release of eggs ) followed by the fertilisation of the egg ( fusion with a sperm ) and implantation in the womb . 
the active substance in ellaOne , ulipristal acetate , acts as a progesterone receptor modulator . 
an additional study compared ellaOne with levonorgestrel ( another medicine used in emergency contraception ) . 
after the first injection , the patient or their partner may give the injections themselves , if they are well motivated , have been trained and have access to expert advice . 
it has also been studied as part of assisted reproductive techniques in 470 women .

when a person is given the vaccine , the immune system recognises the virus parts as ‘ foreign ’ and makes antibodies against it . 
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Focetria to Novartis vaccines and Diagnostics s . r . l . on 2 may 2007 . 
if CEPROTIN is used in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency , antibodies inhibiting protein C may develop . 
when patients start receiving other anticoagulant medicines , such as warfarin , special care is needed and CEPROTIN treatment must be continued until the warfarin treatment is adjusted . 
as the company had supplied the additional information requested , the ’ exceptional circumstances ’ ended on 28 July 2006 . 
in patients starting treatment with oral anticoagulants belonging to the class of vitamin K antagonists ( e.g. warfarin ) , a transient hypercoagulable state may arise before the desired anticoagulant effect becomes apparent . 
see section 4.4 for information on parvovirus B19 infection . 
21 asymptomatic subjects with homozygous or double heterozygous protein C deficiency were evaluated for pharmacokinetic data . 
in patients with acute thrombotic disease , both the incremental increase in protein C plasma levels as well as half-life may be considerably reduced . 
single dose toxicity testing showed that even doses of several times the recommended human dosage per kilogram body weight ( 10 - fold ) did not result in toxic effects on rodents . 
this medicine contains protein C , a natural protein that is made in the liver and is present in your blood . 
the recommended starting dose is one spray actuation ( 27.5 micrograms of fluticasone furoate per spray actuation ) in each nostril once daily ( total daily dose , 55 micrograms ) . 
there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 4.4 and 5.2 ) . 
as with all intranasal corticosteroids , the total systemic burden of corticosteroids should be considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed concurrently . 
growth retardation has been reported in children receiving some nasal corticosteroids at licensed doses . 
caution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent cyp3a 4 inhibitors as an increase in systemic exposure cannot be ruled out . 
in animal studies glucocorticoids have been shown to induce malformations including cleft palate and intra-uterine growth retardation . 
this is not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended nasal doses which results in minimal systemic exposure ( see section 5.2 ) . 
in paediatric clinical studies of up to 12 weeks duration the incidence of epistaxis was similar between patients receiving fluticasone furoate and patients receiving placebo . 
fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid that possesses a very high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and has a potent anti-inflammatory action . 
efficacy was maintained over the full 24 - hour dosing period with once daily administration . 
fluticasone furoate is widely distributed with volume of distribution at steady-state of , on average , 608 l . 
quantifiable levels were observed in 15.1 % of paediatric patients following intranasal dosing of 110 micrograms once daily and only 6.8 % of paediatric patients following 55 micrograms once daily . 
alisade nasal spray is a predominantly off-white plastic device with a dose indicator window , light blue side actuated lever and lid which contains a stopper .

ASA ( 75-100 mg daily ) should be initiated and continued in combination with Clopidogrel ( see section 5.1 ) . 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) has been reported very rarely following the use of Clopidogrel , sometimes after a short exposure . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product . 
glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitors : Clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients who receive concomitant glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitors ( see section 4.4 ) . 
as a precaution , concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole should be discouraged ( see section 4.4 ) . 
other medicinal products : a number of other clinical studies have been conducted with Clopidogrel and other concomitant medicinal products to investigate the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions . 
apart from the specific medicinal product interaction information described above , interaction studies with Clopidogrel and some medicinal products commonly administered in patients with atherothrombotic disease have not been performed . 
Clopidogrel must be metabolised by cyp450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation . 
this benefit was consistent across all prespecified subgroups including patients ’ age and gender , infarct location , and type of fibrinolytic or heparin used . 
after repeated doses of 75 mg Clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic impairment , inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects .

the systemic availability of serotonin may be increased with the use of 5 - HT3 antagonists which may lead to the stimulation of other serotonin receptor subtypes by endogenous serotonin . 
patients can also have reactions to the infusion ( such as fever , chills , rash and hives ) . 
there is no evidence for special considerations when Naglazyme is administered to the paediatric population . 
the initial infusion rate is adjusted so that approximately 2.5 % of the total solution is infused during the first hour , with infusion of the remaining volume ( approximately 97.5 % ) over the next 3 hours . 
in case of a mild or moderate IAR , treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol should be considered and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half the rate at which the reaction occurred . 
in case of a single severe IAR , the infusion should be stopped until the symptoms are resolved and treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol should be considered . 
patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of spinal / cervical cord compression ( including back pain , paralysis of limbs below the level of compression , urinary and faecal incontinence ) and given appropriate clinical care . 
the majority ( 42/59 ; 71 % ) of patients experienced at least one adverse drug reaction . 
other reactions with known frequency were reported from 59 patients treated with Naglazyme from all five clinical trials . 
treated patients experienced a 5.7 Stair per minute improvement in the 3 minute Stair climb relative to placebo-treated patients . 
GAG results approached the normal range for age in the Naglazyme treatment group . 
although limited by the very small number of patients that were enrolled , the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are the following : 
the volume of Naglazyme is to be slowly added to the sodium chloride 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) solution for infusion . 
severe and serious liver toxicities will be assessed through the PSUR but also through analysis of these events in the CSP database . 
interim results will be provided in the annual re-assessment reports . 
- if you have a fever , or if you are having difficulty breathing before this medicine is given , talk with your doctor about delaying your Naglazyme infusion .

in children aged from 9 months to 2 years it is possible that higher plasma concentrations may occasionally occur during treatment with retapamulin 10 mg / g ointment compared to older children and adults . 
there are no data on the effects of retapamulin on human fertility . 
$ in vitro , retapamulin was equally active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains of s . aureus . 
however , in the two studies that enrolled patients with SIOW the efficacy of retapamulin in infections due to MRSA was inadequate ( 75.7 % ) . 
exact CI is calculated using the F-distribution method . 
however by the follow-up visit this difference was less pronounced , ( 88.6 % vs , 81 % for retapamulin and placebo treated subjects respectively ) . 
however , retapamulin showed no advantage over placebo in subjects with SIOW due to s . pyogenes . 
the majority of samples ( 89 % ) were below the lower limit of quantitation ( 0.5 ng / ml ) . 
this plasma concentration was observed in a child with a secondary infected dermatosis , for which retapamulin is not indicated for use . 
four plasma retapamulin concentrations ( 26.9 , 80.3 , 174.3 , and 177.3 ng / ml ) exceeded the highest concentration observed in patients aged 2-17 years ( 18.5 ng / ml ) . 
there were no treatment - related malformations in rats . 
it is possible that using Altargo in children who are taking certain medicines ( such as some medicines used to treat fungal infections ) could result in blood concentrations of Altargo that are higher than usual .

do this by lightly tapping on the upper half of the syringe . 
using Angiox greatly reduces the risk of a blood clot forming . 
it must also not be used in patients who have recently been bleeding , or who have severe high blood pressure , severe kidney problems or a heart infection . 
the infusion dose should be initiated immediately after the bolus dose is administered , ensuring delivery to the patient prior to the procedure , and continued uninterrupted for the duration of the procedure . 
Summary of the safety profile • the most frequent serious and fatal adverse reactions are major haemorrhage ( access site and non access-site bleeding , including intracranial haemorrhage ) and hypersensitivity , including anaphylactic shock . 
injection site reactions ( injection site discomfort , injection site pain , puncture site reaction ) 
section 4.4 describes precautions for INR monitoring when bivalirudin is co-administered with warfarin . 
similar reductions in bleeding were observed in patients who were switched to bivalirudin from heparin-based therapies ( n = 2,078 ) . 
the following data is based on a clinical study of bivalirudin in 6,000 patients undergoing PCI , half of whom were treated with bivalirudin ( replace-2 ) . 
a total of 17 deaths occurred after subacute stent thrombosis , 3 in the bivalirudin arm and 14 in the UFH plus gp IIb / IIIa arm . 
cases of overdose of up to 10 times the recommended dose have been reported in clinical trials . 
1 enoxaparin was used as comparator in acuity only . 
bivalirudin does not bind to plasma proteins ( other than thrombin ) or to red blood cells . 
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety , pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , or toxicity to reproduction . 
undesirable effects that resulted from prolonged physiological stress in response to a non-homeostatic state of coagulation were not seen after short exposure comparable to that in clinical use , even at much higher doses . 
Table 9 summarises compatible and incompatible concentrations of these compounds . 
the medicinal products incompatible with bivalirudin at higher concentrations are : dobutamine hydrochloride , famotidine , haloperidol lactate , labetalol hydrochloride , lorazepam and promethazine HCl . 
Angiox is supplied as a lyophilised powder in 10 ml single use glass vials ( type 1 ) closed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a crimped aluminum seal . 
the use of the Angiox dosing card is recommended as a quick reference guide .

some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level ( decrease , increase or both depending on the situation ) . 
before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what action , if any , you need to take . 
if you switch from another insulin to insulin glulisine , your dosage may have to be adjusted by your doctor . 
you should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low . 
in addition , you should have been provided with information about what to do if you become ill or if your blood sugar levels get too high or too low , or if the pump system fails . 
measure your blood sugar level regularly to make sure you get the benefit of the insulin infusion and to make sure that the pump is working properly . 
pump or infusion set problems or using the pump incorrectly can result in you not getting enough insulin . 
you may need to use Apidra with syringes or pens . 
these could be symptoms of severe cases of generalised allergy to insulin , including anaphylactic reaction , which may be life-threatening . 
these conditions can happen when there are problems with the infusion pump or when the pump system is used incorrectly . 
- you have almost normal or , at least , greatly improved blood sugar levels , 
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines ( see section 2 , " other medicines and
