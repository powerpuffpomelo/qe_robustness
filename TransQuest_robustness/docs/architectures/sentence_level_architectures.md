# Sentence Level TransQuest Architectures
We have introduced two architectures for the sentence level QE in the TransQuest framework, both relies on the XLM-R transformer model.

### Data Preparation
First read your data in to a pandas dataframe and format it so that it has three columns with headers text_a, text_b and labels. text_a is the source text, text_b is the target text and labels are the quality scores as in the following table.

| text_a                                                                    | text_b                                                                                       | labels |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 	නමුත් 1170 සිට 1270 දක්වා රජය පාලනය කරන ලද්දේ යුධ නායකයින් විසිනි.         | But from 1170 to 1270 the government was controlled by warlords.                             | 0.8833 |
|   ව්‍යංගයෙන් ගිවිසුමක් යනු කොන්දේසි වචනයෙන් විස්තර නොකරන ලද එක් අවස්ථාවකි.  | A contract from the constitution is one of the occasions in which the term is not described. | 0.6667 |


Now, you can consider following architectures to build the QE model.

## MonoTransQuest

The first architecture proposed uses a single XLM-R transformer model. The input of this model is a concatenation of the original sentence and its translation, separated by the *[SEP]* token. Then the output of the *[CLS]* token is passed through a softmax layer to reflect the quality scores.

### Minimal Start for a MonoTransQuest Model

Initiate and train the model like in the following code. train_df and eval_df are the pandas dataframes prepared with the instructions in Data Preparation section.

```python
from transquest.algo.sentence_level.monotransquest.evaluation import pearson_corr, spearman_corr
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from transquest.algo.sentence_level.monotransquest.run_model import MonoTransQuestModel
import torch

model = MonoTransQuestModel("xlmroberta", "xlm-roberta-large", num_labels=1, use_cuda=torch.cuda.is_available(),
                               args=monotransquest_config)
model.train_model(train_df, eval_df=eval_df, pearson_corr=pearson_corr, spearman_corr=spearman_corr,
                              mae=mean_absolute_error)
```
An example monotransquest_config is available [here.](https://github.com/TharinduDR/TransQuest/blob/master/examples/sentence_level/wmt_2020/ro_en/monotransquest_config.py). The best model will be saved to the path specified in the "best_model_dir" in monotransquest_config. Then you can load it and do the predictions like this. 

```python
from transquest.algo.sentence_level.monotransquest.run_model import MonoTransQuestModel

model = MonoTransQuestModel("xlmroberta", monotransquest_config["best_model_dir"], num_labels=1,
                               use_cuda=torch.cuda.is_available())

predictions, raw_outputs = model.predict([[source, target]])
print(predictions)

```
Predictions are the predicted quality scores.

##SiameseTransQuest 
The second approach proposed in this framework relies on a Siamese architecture where we feed the original text and the translation into two separate XLM-R transformer models. 

Then the output of all the word embeddings goes through a mean pooling layer. After that we calculate the cosine similarity between the output of the pooling layers which reflects the quality of the translation.

### Minimal Start for a SiameseTransQuest Model

Initiate and train the model like in the following code. train_df and eval_df are the pandas dataframes prepared with the instructions in Data Preparation section.
```python
from transquest.algo.sentence_level.siamesetransquest.run_model import SiameseTransQuestModel


model = SiameseTransQuestModel("xlm-roberta-large", args=siamesetransquest_config)
model.train_model(train_df, eval_df)

```
An example siamese_transformer_config is available [here.](https://github.com/TharinduDR/TransQuest/blob/master/examples/sentence_level/wmt_2020/ro_en/siamesetransquest_config.py). The best model will be saved to the path specified in the "best_model_dir" in siamesetransquest_config. Then you can load it and do the predictions like this. 

```python
from transquest.algo.sentence_level.siamesetransquest.run_model import SiameseTransQuestModel

model = SiameseTransQuestModel(siamesetransquest_config['best_model_dir'])

predictions, raw_outputs = model.predict([[source, target]])
print(predictions)
```

Predictions are the predicted quality scores.
